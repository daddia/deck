    Layout for docs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Docs Page" href="/docs/ui/layouts/page">
    Layout for docs content

    A more compact version of Docs Layout
  </Card>
  <Card title="Home Layout" href="/docs/ui/layouts/home-layout">
    Layout for other pages
  </Card>
</Cards>

### Components

deck UI also offers styled components for interactive examples to enhance your docs, you can customise them with exposed props like `style` and `className`.

See [Components](/docs/ui/components).

### Design System

Since the design system is built on Tailwind CSS, you can customise it [with CSS Variables](/docs/ui/theme#colors).

### CLI

deck CLI is a tool that installs components to your codebase, similar to Shadcn UI.

```package-install
npx @deck/cli
```

Use it to install deck UI components:

```package-install
npx @deck/cli add
```

Or customise layouts:

```package-install
npx @deck/cli customise
```
